This is my personal web related toolkit for pentesting, recon, enum and etc. I will keep this repository updated with scripts I create as time goes by and enhace previous scripts as I get a chance.

**OBS:** Many scripts will need permission to read and write in specific folders, so you'll have to give permission to them to do it. I did by creating a group for all my scripts, adding my user to it and giving this group the rights read and write in */tmp*. But that was my way of doing it, since i didn't want to have to sudo it.
